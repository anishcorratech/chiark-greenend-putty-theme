                <p>
                When new releases come out, this page will update to contain the
                latest, so this is a good page to bookmark or link to.

                <p>
                Release versions of Demo Page we think are reasonably likely
                to work well. However, they are often not the most up-to-date
                version of the code available. If you have a problem with this
                release, then it might be worth trying out
                the <a href="snapshot.html">development snapshots</a>,
                to see if the problem has already been fixed in those versions.

                        <p>You probably want one of these. They include versions of
                        all the utilities (except the new and slightly experimental
                        XFCE Lxterminal).
